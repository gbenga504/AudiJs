# Contributing to AudiJs

Thank you for taking the time to get involved with AudiJs! 

There are several ways you can help the project out:

* [Contributing code](#contributing-code)
* [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs)
* [Feature Requests and Ideas](#feature-requests-and-ideas)

## How Can I Contribute?

### Contributing Code

A lot of AudiJs functionality are still in development, since this is the first version of the API, meaning there is so much more you can contribute to the library. Here is how you can contribute too:

- [x] Fork the repository from the Audi's GitHub page(https://github.com/gbenga504/AudiJs).
- [x] Clone a copy to your local machine with `$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USER-NAME/audiJs.git`
- [x] Audi does not have any dependencies so you may not need to worry about that 
- [x] Then code and test your codes, add any changes you might have in mind here  
- [x] Audijs run with or without a local server so its not dependent on one
- [x] Once you've made sure all your changes work correctly and have been committed, push your local changes back to github with `$ git push -u origin master`
- [x] Visit your fork on GitHub.com ([https://github.com/YOUR-USER-NAME/AudiJs](https://github.com/YOUR-USER-NAME/AudiJs)) and create a pull request for your changes.
- [x] Makes sure your pull request describes exactly what you changed and if it relates to an open issue references that issue (just include the issue number in the title like this: #100)

#### Important:
* Do not change the [API docs](https://github.com/gbenga504/AudiJs/README.md) in `/README.md` directly. This file is generated automatically, and your changes will be overwritten.
* Do not update the version number yourself.
* Please stick to the project's existing coding style. Coding styles don't need to have a consensus, they just need to be consistent :smile:. Es6 would be used subsequently in future versions
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository. Your branch should be based on the `master` branch.


### Reporting Bugs
Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem.

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem. Share the relevant code to reproduce the issue if possible.
* Try to isolate the issue as much as possible, reducing unrelated code until you get to the minimal amount of code in which the bug still reproduces. This is the most important step to help the community solve the issue.
